### About This Repository

This repository contains my practice projects in Angular, developed to deepen my understanding of front-end development and enhance my skills. These projects aim to:  
- Practice and grasp core concepts of Angular framework.  
- Build logic for developing dynamic and interactive web applications.  
- Explore various approaches to solving problems and writing clean, maintainable code.  
- Utilize different Angular features, libraries, and tools effectively.  

These projects serve as a foundation for mastering Angular and experimenting with real-world scenarios.

### Note
I am uploading only the `src` files for these projects. If you want to use or run these projects, follow the steps below:  

1. **Create a New Angular Project**:  
   Use the Angular CLI to create a new project:  
   ```bash  
   ng new <project-name>  
   ```  

2. **Replace the `src` Folder**:  
   Replace the `src` folder in the newly created project with the `src` folder from this repository.  

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  

4. **Run the Project**:  
   Start the development server to view the project in your browser:  
   ```bash  
   ng serve  
   ```  

Now, the project should run successfully, and you can explore and modify the code as needed.
